# Logic games with hand-waving and playing cards

## Hands up!

Discuss how humans are smart, but computers are stupid: they can only do exactly what you tell them to.

* "When I put my arm up, you put your arm out to the side."
* Do a few times.
* "When I put my arm up, you put your arm out to the side. When I put my arm out to the side, you put your arm up."
* Do a few times.
* On a flipchart, discuss and write up the code. "If you needed to give instructions to someone to do the same things, but couldn't speak, what would you write?" Two `if`s.
* Do a few times. End with something a bit mad that's not covered by the `if`s.
* On a flipchart, discuss and write up the code.

## Draw!

Have some `{{ things }}` for scoring. I like to use (and ask them to draw) animals.

* Explain the rules for the next section.
    * Draw a card.
    * If the card is red, score 1 `{{ first_thing }}`.
    * If the card is bigger than 7, score 1 `{{ second_thing }}`.
    * Draw a total of 10 cards.
* What happened when you got a red card with a large number?
* What happened when you got a joker or a picture card?
* Discuss how can we want to score only 1 point for each card, and score a point if it's not Red and not bigger than 7. (Add `if`, `else if` and `else`)
* Draw it out with a big `else` bracket, with the second `if else` inside.
* Next set of rules
    * Draw a card.
    * If the card is red, score 1 {{ first_thing }}.
    * Else If the card is bigger than 7, score 1 {{ second_thing }}.
    * Else score 1 {{ third_thing }}.
    * Draw a total of 10 cards.
